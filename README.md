My motivation in building this website was to make a updated version of my portfolio using bootstrap. I've built this website to show my skills in bootstrap. The problem that this website solves is it showcases my skills in bootstrap which i have not used in my other projects. What i learned in building this website was how to use bootstrap to structure my websites.
